Contributing to EZ Templates
============================

Per Jenkins' maintainers [express preference][1], Github Issues and Wiki are disabled. Please raise any items
on [Jenkins JIRA site][3] and find our wiki area [here][2].

Before writing code and sending a Pull Request for anything more than an obviously minor bugfix, please discuss it
through a [JIRA][3]. Please note that there is work underway to rewrite the core of this plugin to make it much more
flexible. Additions to the v1 stream that add significant complexity for a single feature will need to be exceptional
as they make any future migration much harder.
